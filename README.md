This project initially started as an attempt to use Python to create a package that could serve as a free text reader, and speech to text editor.
Because of time constraints and the Linux/Ubuntu variables that would have to be altered to incorporate the Python needed to make this possible, the 
project became instead a website.

The simple files do work on windows, and can be found in the file: chinguV22Tests , here in the repo.  Feel free to use them in your own experiments or projects.

On this page demonstrations that are interactive can be used to show users how contrast, color, and font play a role in usability">
</p>

This page is also a demonstration of the importance of contrast, and color in a web design.   The interactive color wheel, with explanation below can give creators
a visual reference as to what it means for colors to be contrasting or complementary.

Below in a tabable set of articles, the user can find helpful links, and another interactive example that shows why the color, and the font can make a huge difference
in the user experience. 

Documentation for the color wheel's code can be found in: Documentation/WheelDoc.txt

Morse code, Maths, Sciences, Sign Language, Pictorials, writing... the list of languages and capabilities of the human species to communicate is vast and ever growing.  On this page you can learn the ASL alphabet and challenge yourself with a new way of communicating.
