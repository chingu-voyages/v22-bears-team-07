Sight and Sound | Voyage-22 | https://chingu.io/

This project initially started as an attempt to use Python to create a package that could serve as a free text reader, and speech to text editor.
Because of time constraints and the Linux/Ubuntu variables that would have to be altered to incorporate the Python needed to make this possible, the 
project became instead a website of three pages.

The simple files do work on windows, and can be found in the file: chinguV22Tests , here in the repo.  Feel free to use them in your own experiments or projects.


## Page:  Sound and Silence

This page will demonstrate the importance of the alt attribute using buttons that a user can press to hear the readback of the alt attribute to three images.
A brief overview and a list of resources round out this page.

## Page: Color and Contrast 

This page is also a demonstration of the importance of contrast, and color in a web design.   The interactive color wheel, with explanation below can give creators
a visual reference as to what it means for colors to be contrasting or complimentary.

Below in a tabable set of articles, the user can find helpful links, and another interactive example that shows why the color, and the font can make a huge difference
on the user experience. 

Documentation for the color wheel's code can be found in: Documentation/WheelDoc.txt

Morse code, Maths, Sciences, Sign Language, Pictorials, writing... the list of languages and capabilities of the human species to communicate is vast and ever growing.
