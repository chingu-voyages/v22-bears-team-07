                        A little explanation of primary, secondary, and the color wheel in art.
                        <br>
                        The three primary colors are red, yellow and blue.  Secondary colors, colors inbetween the primaries are orange, green and purple.
                        <br> The color wheel is an art tool that helps artists visualize where colors are on this spectrum in relation to each other.
                        When paint is mixed, like a primary yellow and a primary blue, there will be the effect that a green is created.
                        It is only an effect however, because the yellow pigment and the blue pigment don't actually combine, but the color reflected off them
                        becomes mixed as it bounces back to the eye to make it seem like a new color is made.  Green.
                        <br>A compliment color can be found on the color wheel in the same quadrant as each others. As neighbors on the color wheel
                      the colors are relational to the primary color they are made from.  Green is a compliment of yellow and blue.  In very basic terms
                      yellow and blue can be combined to appear green.  These three colors are complimentary to each other.
                          <br />
                          Compliment colors can be great for fluid visual design, and can be used throughout a site for design purposes.
                          The exception being when information is important. This information, such as form text and labels, text that is there to help guide
                          users, and instructions should never be complimentary colors.  Accenting with a complementary color is fine. Just remember you want
                          everyone to see the hard work you did.  Even if they lost their glasses. </p>

                          A more technical explanation: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/Understanding_WCAG/Perceivable/Color_contrast">MDN docs</a>.
                          <br />
                          Contrast in the art world is when two colors are opposite each other on the color wheel.  To the normal human eye, these colors seem to battle agains each other
                          to gain the most focus.   While true contrast in art are the most saturated, or closest to their prime color root, oppose each other on the color wheel, in websites there are a few differences.
                          For example, while red and green are 'clashing' or opposing colors on the wheel, someone who is red green color blind will not see the same thing others do.
                          To adjust for that, you can adjust the brightness of the foreground and the text color.  Black and white are full contrast.  When color starts
                          being added to the mix, remember that the lightness is just a big a factor in the contrast ratio as are the color choices.

                                  <br />
                                  There are many sites that can calculate your contrast ratio.  It's only a google away.  But if you can keep in mind the wheel above, it is easier
                                  to develop the proper ratio on your own.   The text against the background is the most important, then comes the font size, and it's readability.<br />
                                  A fancy, cursive font can be very appealing, but check to make sure it doesn't become invisible when the contrast starts to get low.

                                      The contrast of a page is very important to those who do not have typical eyesight.
                                      <br> If you, or someone you know has to wear glasses for nearsightedness, imagine
                                      they had to read this without their glasses.  Would they have to struggle?
                                      <br>
                                      Colorblindness can also play a role.  If your text color and background color are not sufficiently contrasted,
                                      a yellow on green may become impossible for someone with <a href="https://www.color-blindness.com/deuteranopia-red-green-color-blindness/">deuteranomaly</a> to see.
                                      Font types play a role in contrast in this way also.  If a text is thin, or the font is easily blurred into
                                      visually incoherent blobs, the information is now inaccessible.
                                      If the font is hard to read, it will be hard to read for those that have visual differences.
                                      <br><br>
                                      Below, try changing the font with the selections, and blurring this article with the button.
